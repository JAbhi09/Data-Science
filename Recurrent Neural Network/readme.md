# Recurrent Neural Network

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of neural networks tailored for sequential data processing in deep learning. They employ looping connections that enable information retention across time steps, making them well-suited for tasks like natural language processing, time series analysis, and speech recognition. RNNs maintain a hidden state that evolves with each input element, allowing them to capture dependencies in sequences. However, they can suffer from vanishing gradient problems over long sequences, which has led to the development of more advanced variants like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to better handle long-range dependencies and improve performance in various sequential data tasks.
