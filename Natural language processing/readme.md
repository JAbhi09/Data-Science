# Natural language processing

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. Its primary goal is to enable machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and practical. NLP has found applications in a wide range of fields, from machine translation and sentiment analysis to chatbots and speech recognition. It involves various tasks, such as tokenization (breaking text into words or phrases), part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and syntactic and semantic analysis, all of which contribute to the understanding of natural language.

# Project Details

**Project-1 :- Movie Review Project**

*Project Overview*

The movie_reviews corpus in NLTK is a well-known dataset that contains movie reviews categorized as positive and negative. The movie_reviews corpus in NLTK is primarily used for sentiment analysis and text classification tasks. This corpus consists of 2,000 movie reviews, with each review being stored as a separate text file. These reviews are evenly divided into two categories: positive and negative, with 1,000 reviews in each category. The reviews in the movie_reviews corpus are pre-labeled as positive or negative, making it suitable for supervised learning tasks.


**Project-2 :- Twitter US airline sentiment analysis**

*Project Overview*

This project demonstrates a text sentiment analysis application using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and the scikit-learn library. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of determining the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in text data. In this project, we focus on classifying text as positive, negative, or neutral based on its sentiment.
