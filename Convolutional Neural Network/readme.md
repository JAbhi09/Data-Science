# Convolutional Neural Network

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models specifically designed for processing and analyzing visual data, such as images and videos. They have revolutionized computer vision tasks by leveraging convolutional layers to automatically learn and extract hierarchical features from input images. CNNs excel at tasks like image classification, object detection, and image segmentation due to their ability to capture spatial patterns and hierarchies of features. They consist of multiple layers, including convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for spatial downsampling, and fully connected layers for classification. CNNs have played a pivotal role in various applications, from self-driving cars to medical image analysis, making them a fundamental tool in modern machine learning and computer vision.

**Project Details**

**Project-1 : Covid-19 Case CLassification**

*Project Overview*

A COVID-19 image dataset comprises medical images, predominantly chest X-rays, collected from COVID-19-positive individuals, individuals with other respiratory conditions, and healthy subjects for comparative analysis. These datasets are commonly utilized in medical image analysis research, where Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are often employed for automated COVID-19 detection and classification. Data augmentation techniques, such as those implemented with ImageDataGenerator, are frequently used to augment the dataset, enhancing the CNN model's generalization and performance.
