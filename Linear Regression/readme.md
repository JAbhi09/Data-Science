# Linear Regression

Linear regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes that the relationship can be approximated by a linear equation, such as a straight line. By analyzing the data and finding the best-fitting line, linear regression aims to understand how changes in the independent variables affect the dependent variable. It's widely employed in various fields for prediction, inference, and understanding correlations. The model's performance is assessed through metrics like the coefficient of determination (R-squared) and root mean square error (RMSE), helping to determine the goodness of fit for the data.

**Project 1: Gradient Descent on Boston (From Scratch)**

This project delves into the implementation and comparison of two gradient descent variants, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Batch Gradient Descent (BGD), on the Boston dataset. By analyzing their convergence, computational efficiency, coherence of results, and performance metrics, we explore the trade-offs between these methods. The findings offer valuable insights into selecting the most suitable gradient descent approach for datasets of varying sizes and characteristics.

**Project 2: Linear Regression and Feature Engineering**

In this project, we explore the impact of feature augmentation on linear regression models. Focusing on the delicate balance between model complexity and generalization, we uncover the potential pitfalls of overfitting that can arise from augmented features.

**Project 3: Mobile App vs. Website Analysis for Ecommerce**

This project takes on the intriguing challenge of aiding an Ecommerce company's decision-making process. By analyzing customer data, we assess the relative strengths of the mobile app and website in driving sales. Through linear regression analysis, we reveal insights into the impact of each platform on customer spending. Our recommendations guide the company in enhancing both the mobile app and website to strike a harmonious balance and maximize customer engagement and sales.

**Project 4: Company Profit Prediction using Linear Regression**

In this project, we embark on predicting company profits using linear regression. By examining the influence of R&D spending, administration costs, marketing investments, and state location, we build a predictive model with a high R-squared score. Our model sheds light on the most influential factors and assists businesses in optimizing resource allocation and strategy formulation for sustainable profit growth.
