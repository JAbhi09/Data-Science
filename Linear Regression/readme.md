Linear regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes that the relationship can be approximated by a linear equation, such as a straight line. By analyzing the data and finding the best-fitting line, linear regression aims to understand how changes in the independent variables affect the dependent variable. It's widely employed in various fields for prediction, inference, and understanding correlations. The model's performance is assessed through metrics like the coefficient of determination (R-squared) and root mean square error (RMSE), helping to determine the goodness of fit for the data.
