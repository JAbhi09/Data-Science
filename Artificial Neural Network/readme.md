# Artificial Neural Network

An artificial neural network (ANN) is a computational model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It consists of interconnected nodes, or artificial neurons, organized into layers. Neurons process information through weighted inputs and activation functions, allowing the network to learn and make predictions based on data. ANNs are a fundamental component of machine learning and have been applied to various tasks, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and complex pattern recognition. Training ANNs involves adjusting the weights to minimize the difference between predicted and actual outcomes. The architecture of ANNs can range from simple feedforward networks to more complex structures like recurrent and convolutional networks, enabling them to excel in a wide range of applications across different domains.

# Project Details


**Project-1 :- ANN from Scratch**

*Project Overview*

- Simple Neural Network Implmentation with and without hidden layers using Numpy library
- Define the input data and output labels, basically AND operation(without hidden layer).
- Define the input data matrix and output data matrix that is actually a XOR function(with hidden layer).

**Project-2 :- ANN Churn Model**

*Project Overview*

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using a custom neural network architecture and hyperparameter tuning. The dataset containing customer information is preprocessed through data splitting and standard scaling. Hyperparameter tuning is conducted using GridSearchCV to optimize the neural network's configuration.
