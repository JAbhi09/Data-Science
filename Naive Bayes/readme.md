# Naive Bayes

Naive Bayes is a widely used machine learning algorithm known for its simplicity and effectiveness in classification tasks. It operates based on Bayes' theorem and the "naive" assumption that all features used for classification are independent, simplifying complex probability calculations. Despite its simplicity, Naive Bayes performs well in various applications, including spam detection, sentiment analysis, and document categorization. There are different variants of Naive Bayes, such as Multinomial Naive Bayes and Gaussian Naive Bayes. While it has its limitations, like sensitivity to feature independence assumptions, Naive Bayes remains a valuable tool for many real-world machine learning problems.

## Project Details

**Project-1 :- Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier Implementation**

*Project Overview*

The Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm that is particularly useful for text classification and categorical data analysis. It's based on the Naive Bayes theorem, which uses Bayes' rule to calculate the probability of a data point belonging to a specific class based on its feature values.

In this project, we have implemented key functions for training and using a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier. These functions enable you to train the classifier on labeled training data and make predictions on new, unlabeled data.

**Project-2 :- Salary Prediction Classification**

*Project Overview*

The Census Income Dataset, extracted by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database, is a widely used dataset for classification tasks. The primary objective of this dataset is to predict whether an individual's annual income exceeds $50,000 based on various demographic and socio-economic attributes. This dataset is commonly used for binary classification tasks, particularly for predicting income levels. It serves as an excellent resource for practicing classification algorithms and exploring feature engineering techniques.


**Project-3 :- Text Classification with 20 Newsgroups Dataset**

*Project Overview*

This project focuses on text classification using the widely recognized 20 Newsgroups dataset. The primary goal is to develop a machine learning model capable of categorizing text documents into one of 20 predefined news categories. The objective of this project is to demonstrate the process of text classification and showcase the performance of the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier on the 20 Newsgroups dataset.
